# EventAnalysis
Used to quickly process multiple Wave files generated by Eventer analysis.
Eventer is a synaptic analysis program (see https://eventerneuro.netlify.app/#about) used to detect spontaneous or miniature synaptic currents.

In a typical analysis, a long recording file (.abf) is broken up into 'Waves' (segments of recordings, perhaps 2-3 minutes in length).  All of the Waves and associated analyses are stored in the eventer.output folder.
When there are many Wave folders to analyze, this can be time consuming.  So this routine was written to facilitate pulling all the data together.

The user begins by selecting a Root Directory that will contain multiple recordings.  For example, if you have your data organized by date, you might select \sIPSC Analysis\DATE\  as your root.  Then within that, you may have Cell1, Cell2, Cell3 for each recording. Once a root is selected, you can select the subfolder containing ALL of the Data_YWAVE files.  You can select either single waves, or multiple for analysis.  The program will go through and pull (1) Summary data (number of events, mean amplitude and frequency), as well as (2) the peak amplitude and interevent intervals (IEI). Summary data will be placed in a table, and cumulative distributions for the amplitude and IEIs will be plotted. The user also has the option to create averaged cumulative distributions from subsets of the Wave files.  For example, if Waves 1-3 are from a control period, and Waves 8-10 are from a drug treatment, you can average rather than plotting just a single epoch.  All of the cumulative functions, as well as the summary table, can then be saved to an Excel workbook for further use.

Note: This code was written in about 2 hours with the help of Claude AI!
