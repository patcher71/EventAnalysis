# EventAnalysis

This program is designed to quickly process multiple Wave files generated by the Eventer analysis software and generate cumulative distribution functions of typical parameters (amplitude, interevent interval).
Eventer is a robust and excellent synaptic analysis program (see https://eventerneuro.netlify.app/#about and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39345285/) used to detect spontaneous or miniature synaptic currents.

In a typical analysis, a long recording file (.abf) is broken up into 'Waves' (segments of recordings, perhaps 2-3 minutes in length).  All of the Waves and associated parameters are stored in the eventer.output folder.
When there are many Wave folders to analyze, it can be time consuming to go through each folder to pull out the analysis.  So this routine was written in about 2 hours (with the help of Claude AI!) to facilitate pulling all the data together and generate a summary table and cumulative distribution functions.

## Data organization and handling

The user begins by selecting a Root Directory that contain multiple recordings.  For example, if you have your data organized by date, you might select \sIPSC Analysis\DATE\  as your root.  Then within that, you should have folders Cell1, Cell2, Cell3 for each recording (\Cell1\eventer.output\, \Cell2\eventer.output\ , etc). Once a root is selected, you can select the Cell subfolder containing the Data_YWAVE files.  You can select either single waves, or multiple for analysis.  The program will go through and pull (1) Summary data (number of events, mean amplitude and frequency), as well as (2) the peak amplitude and interevent intervals (IEI). Summary data will be placed in a table, and cumulative distributions for the amplitude and IEIs will be plotted. The user also has the option to create averaged cumulative distributions from subsets of the Wave files.  For example, if Waves 1-3 are from a control period, and Waves 8-10 are from a drug treatment, you can average rather than plotting just a single epoch.  All of the cumulative functions, as well as the summary table, can then be saved to an Excel workbook for further use.

### Version history

**v3**: Added a routine to filter events so that any unusual large amplitude events, such as unclamped currents or noise, can be quickly excluded.  Future updates will hopefully allow for a more detailed review/curation of events by reading the event_data file generated by Eventer.

**v4**:  Allows for tagging on Waves by treatment (Control, or up to 3 named Drug Conditions). To name, just hit the 'Name' button and then give the drug names in the pop up window. Then select the files and the appropriate tag using the dropdown and hit 'Tag.' This will add labels under the 'condition' column in the table.
